## Definition of a linear equation:
A linear equation in n variables $x_{1} ... x_{n}$ is an equation of the form $a_{1}x_{1} + a_{2}x_{2}+ ... + a_{n}x_{n} = b$

The scalars $a_{1} ... a_{n}$ are the coefficients of the equation.

## Definition of a system of linear equations
A system of m linear equations in n variables is given by:
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{*{3}{rC}l}
    a_{11}x_{1} & + &  a_{12}x_{2} & + & a_{1n}x_{n} & = & b_{1} \\
    a_{21}x_{1} & + &  a_{22}x_{2} & + &  a_{2n}x_{n} & = &  b_{2} \\
    . &  &  . &  &  . &  &  . \\
    . &  &  . &  &  . &  &  . \\
    a_{m1}x_{1} & + &  a_{m2}x_{2} & + & a_{mn}x_{n} & = & b_{m}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
