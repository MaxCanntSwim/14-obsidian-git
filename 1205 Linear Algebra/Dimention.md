**Definition**
The **dimension** **dim W** of a **nonzero** subspace **W** is the **number** of vectors in any **basis** for W.
**Remark**
The dimension of a zero subspace {$\vec{0}$} is defined to be zero.

# The basis Theorem
Let W be a **p**-dimentional subspace of $ℝ^{n}$
1. Any linearly **independent** set of exactly **p** elements in **W** is a **basis** for **W**
2. Any set of **p** elements of **W** that spans **W** is a basis for **W**

# The rank Theorem
**Definition**
The rank of a matrix A, denoted by rankA, is the dimention of the column space of A
**Theorem**
If a matrix A has n columns, then$$rankA+dimNulA=n$$



# Coordinate vector
**Theorem**
Let $B=\{ \vec{B}_{1},...,\vec{b}_{p}\}$ be a basis for a subspace W of $ℝ^{n}$, and $\vec{x}∈W$ Then there are unique weights $c_{1},...,c_{p}$ such that $$\vec{x}= c_{1}\vec{b}_{1}+c_{2}\vec{b}_{2},...,c_{p}\vec{b}_{p}$$The weights $c_{1},...,c_{p}$ form the B-coordinate vector of $\vec{x}$.
