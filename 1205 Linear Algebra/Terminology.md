# Null Space
Nul A of a matrix A is the set of all solutions of the homogeneous equation $A \vec{x}=\vec{0}$

## Theorem
The null space Nul A of an m x n matrix A is a subspace of $ℝ^{n}$

## alg for basis for null space
Given an m x n matrix A, find a basis for **Nul** A:
1. **Solve** the homogeneous system $A \vec{x}=\vec{0}$
2. **Write** your solution in parametric vector form
3. The vectors **occurring** in this **parametric** vector form, for a **basis** for Nul A

# Column Space
Col A of a matrix is the span of the columns of A.

## Theorem
The column space Col A of an m x n matrix A is a subspace of $ℝ^{m}$

The **pivot** **columns** of a matrix A form a basis for the column space A
