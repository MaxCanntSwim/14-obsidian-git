Let there be a number $c$ in the domain of function $f$ then $f(c)$ is 
* absolute maximum of $f$ on $D$ 
	* ∀x∈$D$($f(c)>=f(x)$)
* absolute minimum
	* ∀x∈$D$($f(c)<=f(x)$)
local maximum $f(c)>=f(x)$ in the neighbourhood. 
local minimum $f(c)<=f(x)$ in the neighourhood. 

If $c$ is a local min or max, than $f'(c)=0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist. 

Extreme value theorum, if $f$ is continuous on **closed** interval $[a,b]$ then $f$ atains absolute max $f(c)$ and absolute min $f(d)$. This does **not** hold if the interval is not closed or not continuous.
