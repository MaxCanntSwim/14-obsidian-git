In calculus, an integral is a mathematical object that can be interpreted as an area or a generalization of area. Integrals, together with [[Derivative]], are the fundamental objects of calculus. Other words for integral include antiderivative and primitive.

The mathematical definition is:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{i} f(x_i)*∆x$$
$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx=\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^{i} f(x_i)*∆x$$
## fundamental theorum
If f is continuous than the function F is defined by: 
$$F(x)=\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$$
$$a<=x<=b$$
is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on (a,b) and $F'(x)=f(x)$

**Definite Intergral**: $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$, outcome is a number
**Indefinite intergral**: $\int f(x) \,dx$, outcome is general anti-derivatives. 





$$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx$$
