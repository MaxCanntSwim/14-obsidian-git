In calculus, and more generally in mathematical analysis, integration by parts or partial integration isÂ a process that finds the integral of a product of functions in terms of the [[Integral]] of the product of their derivative and antiderivative. 
Integration by parts might make the integration easier, but this is not a given.

$$\int f(x)\,g'(x)\,dx=f(x)\,g(x)-\int f'(x)\,g(x)\,dx$$
Example:
$$\int x\cos{(x)}$$
$$f(x)=x$$
$$f'(x)=1$$
$$g'(x)=\cos{(x)}$$
$$g(x)=\sin{(x)}$$
$$f(x)\,g(x)=x\sin{(x)}$$
$$\int f'(x)\,g(x)\,dx=\int 1*\sin{(x)}=-\cos{(x)}$$
$$\int x\cos{(x)}\,dx=x\sin{(x)}+\cos{(x)}+C$$
