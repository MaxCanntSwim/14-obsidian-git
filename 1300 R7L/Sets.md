* A is a subset of B
	* A ⊆ B

* A is a proper subset of B
	* A ⊊ B

* Union of A and B
	* A ∪ B

* Intersection of A and B
	* A ∩ B

* Set difference between A and B
	* A – B

* Symmetric difference of A and B
	* A ∆ B
	* {x |(x ∈ A ∧ x ̸∈ B) ∨ (x ̸∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)}

* Cartesian product
	* A × B
	* {(a, b)| a ∈ A and b ∈ B}

* Everything except the set
	* A^c

* The set of all possible sets made with the base set
	* P(A)
	* {X | X ⊆ A}

* Relations
	* reflexive if for all x ∈ A: xRx
		* for instance R: (=) ⊆ ℝ x ℝ
	* symmetric if for all x, y ∈ A: xRy →yRx
		* Here the same example can be used as above, x = y = π.
	* transitive if for all x, y, z ∈ A: (xRy ∧ yRz) → xRz.
		* For instance R : (<) ⊆ ℤ x ℤ, where for instance x, y, z can be taken as x = 1, y = 2 and z = 3, if x is smaller than y and y is smaller than z than x is smaller than z
