1. What is the difference between element-wise and aggregation operations?
2. What is the function signature for `foldL`?
3. What is the difference between `reduceL` and `reduceR`?
4. How can we implement `map`, `filter`, `zip` etc with `reduce`?
5. How can we implement a `join` between KV pairs?

1. Operations are transformations, aggregations or cross-referencing of data stored in data types. All of container data types can be iterated. We generally have two types of operations: 
	- **Element-wise** ops apply a function to each individual message (e.g. map or flatMap)
		- **Conversion**: convert values of type
		- **Filtering**: only present data items that match a condition
		- **Projection**: Only present parts of each data item
	- **Aggregations** group multiple events together and apply a reduction (e.g. fold or max) on them
		- Apply a combining operation on a traversable sequence to aggregate the individual items into a singel result. 
		- foldLeft/foldRight
2. $foldLeft(xs:[A],init:B,f:(acc:B,x:A)→B)→B$
3. reduceL starts at the beginning of the list and works to the end of the list
	reduceR starts at the end of the list and works to the beginning
4. the implementation
	```Scala
	def customMap[A, B](list: List[A], f: A => B): List[B] = {
	  list.reverse.foldLeft(List.empty[B]) { (acc, element) =>
	    f(element) :: acc
	  }
	}
	def customFilter[A](list: List[A], predicate: A => Boolean): List[A] = {
	  list.reverse.foldLeft(List.empty[A]) { (acc, element) =>
	    if (predicate(element)) element :: acc else acc
	  }
	}
	def customZip[A, B](list1: List[A], list2: List[B]): List[(A, B)] = {
	  list1.reverse.zip(list2.reverse).foldLeft(List.empty[(A, B)]) { (acc, pair) =>
	    pair :: acc
	  }
	}
	```
5. the implementation
```Scala
def deanAddresses2: List[(Dean, Addr)] =
  deans.flatMap(d =>
    addr.filter(a => a.k == d.k)
     .map(a => (d, v)))
```
