L'hospital is a way to evaluate limits in the case of $\lim\limits_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
where both $\lim\limits_{x \to a}f(x)=0=\lim\limits_{x \to a}{g(x)}$, 
then $\lim\limits_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim\limits_{x \to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$
Thus if the limit at a for both f and g is 0 then the limit of the derivative of both will suffice. [[Derivative]] has to be applied on both the denominator and the numerator.
