# Philosophy 
- The whole > the sum of the parts
- Complex tasks can be tackled only through cooperation of the multitude
- The outcome of the effort comes at a group level
	- The single parts may not be aware of the bigger goal
	- There is no leader or centralised coordination
	- Interaction/coordination happens at a microlevel
		- Direct through senses
		- Indirect through changes in the environment
- Complex systems
	- self-organization
	- Emergent properties
	- No central planning

# What
- Computational swarm intelligence:  
    - Algorithms that define simple individual behavior modulated by simple interactions between individuals 
    - Emergent group behavior
    
- Focus on the individual actors, not on the whole system (which might be too complex to model)

# Ant Colony Optimization

- A big advantage of ACO is its inherent flexibility
- Environment and conditions might be unknown and/or dynamic (changing over time) 
	- Internet: node breaks down
    - Highway: closed for accident

- Ant keep exploring: they adapt fast
- Pheromone gives backup options  
    - If a link is closed, the second shortest route is easy to reconstruct
