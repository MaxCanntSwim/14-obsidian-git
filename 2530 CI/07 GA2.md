find the set of solutions that define the best possible tradeoffs between competing objectives
## Pareto Optimality
**Premise**
A solution is Pareto optimal when there exists no other solution that improves at least one objective without degrading the performance in any other objective

**Purpose**
To rank alternatives in multi-objective problems![[Screenshot 2024-04-14 at 13.56.11.jpg]]
