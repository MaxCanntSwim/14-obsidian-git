# Definition
an **experiment** is an **activity** or **procedure** that produces **distinct** possibilities, called **outcomes**. 
In probability and statistics, **randomness** is involved: outcome is **uncertain**.
The **set** of all **outcomes** is called the **sample space**. 

When **grouping** outcomes together in an experiment, it is called an **event**: this is a **subset** of Ω (sample space)
# Example
Throw a red and a blue die
e.g red : 5
	blue : 3
	outcome = (5,3)
**Sample space**: the set of all outcomes
$\Omega =\{ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)... \}$
	=$\{ (i,j):1≤i,j≤6 \}$
E: sum of the two die throws is 4
	=$\{ (3,1),(2,2),(1,3) \}$
