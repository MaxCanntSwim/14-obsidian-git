# Definition
Two random variables X and Y are independent if:$$P(X≤a,Y≤b)=P(X≤a)P(Y≤b)$$for all possible values of a and b. Otherwise, dependent.
Discrete: $P(X=a,Y=b)=P(X=a)P(Y=b)$, for all possible values of a and b. 
Continuous: $f(x,y)=f_{x}(x)f_{y}(y)$, for all x and y.

# Example

## two dice
M= maximum
S= sum

M and S are not independent since if we know that the maximum is 1 than the sum can never be 12
$P(S=12|M=1)=0≠P(S=12)$
