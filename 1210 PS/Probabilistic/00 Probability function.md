# Definition
Let **Ω** be a sample space. A **probability function** **P** assigns to each event **A** in **Ω** a number **P(A)** in $[0,1]$ such that: 
1. P(Ω) = 1
2. P(A∪B) = P(A)+P(B), **if** A and B are disjoint
The number P(A) is called the **probability** of **A**
# Example
Experiment: month of birth of random person
Sample space: Ω = {Jan, Feb, ..., Nov, Dec}.
Assume equal probabilities for all months. 

Let A be the event A = {Born in an even month}
What is P(A)
	P(A)=$\frac{1}{2}$ 
P({Jan})=$\frac{1}{12}$ Alternative $\frac{31}{365}$ or $\frac{31}{365.25}$
