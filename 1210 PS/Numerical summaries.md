1. average/mean


Dataset: 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6 , 8, 12
- Average: $\bar{x}_{11}=\frac{0+1+4+...+12}{11}=5$
- median: 5 (in a sorted dataset, the middle number, the central observation) if even number of entries, take the average of the middle two number
- minimum: 0, maximum: 12
- lower quartile: $Q_{1}$= 4 (a number such that in a sorted set, ~25% of the entries is to the left and ~75% is to the right)![[IMG_3914.jpeg]]
- upper quartile: $Q_{3}$= 6 (a number such that in a sorted set, ~75% of the entries is to the left and ~25% is to the right)
