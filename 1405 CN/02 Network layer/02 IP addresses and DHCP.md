# assignment
ISPs have a set of IP addresses they can assign to devices in their network. 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigns IP ranges to regional internet registries. Those in turn assign them to ISPs. 
ISPs maintain servers in their networks that can be contacted for IPs when a new device joins the network.
